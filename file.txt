Qno 4.Difference between static and dynamic website.
 
ans- A static website is a website that has fixed content usually written in HTML. It is a basic kind of website and does not have custom coding and dynamic features.
  It only requires client-side languages such as HTML and CSS to build the website. HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language. 

A dynamic website is a website whose content changes according to the user’s request. It is not just to read. Instead, it provides more user interaction and functionalities.
 These websites use client-side languages such as HTML and CSS as well as server-side scripting languages such as ASP.NET, PHP, Java Server Pages (JSP), and Python to develop the pages.
